This project is using Remix Vite, always refer to vite docs instead of remix classic docs.
- Always use Tailwind CSS version 4 for styling and utilize shadcn ui to add components that they support and we dont currently dont have in the codebase, utilize radix ui for components structure.
- Always follow official best practices from Remix.run and Vite.dev.
- Try to avoid useEffect whenever possible.
- Don't write any comments in the code.
- Always use absolute paths (path alias).
