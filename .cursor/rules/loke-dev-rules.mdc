This project is using Remix Vite, always refer to vite docs instead of remix classic docs.
- Always use pnpm as the package manager!
- Always use Tailwind CSS version 4 for styling and utilize shadcn ui to add components that they support and we dont currently dont have in the codebase, utilize radix ui for components structure.
- Tailwind version 4 does not use a js config file, dont create one.
- Always follow official best practices from respective package/tool.
- Try to avoid useEffect whenever possible.
- Always check if i have started a dev server on port 3000 already before starting another one.
- Don't write any comments in the code.
- Always use path aliases for internal import (example @/components/button).
