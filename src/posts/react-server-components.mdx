# Understanding React Server Components

React Server Components (RSC) represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. Let's explore what makes them special.

## What Are Server Components?

Server Components render exclusively on the server and send HTML to the client. This approach offers several benefits:

  Server Components can access server-side resources directly without additional
  API layers.
</Callout>

## Key Benefits

| Benefit           | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero Bundle Size  | Server components don't add to your JavaScript bundle |
| Direct DB Access  | Query databases without intermediate APIs             |
| Improved Security | Sensitive logic stays on the server                   |
| Better SEO        | Content is server-rendered and ready for crawlers     |

## Server vs. Client Components

```tsx
// Server Component (app/page.tsx)
import { db } from '@/lib/db'

export default async function Posts() {
  const posts = await db.post.findMany()

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Client Components are marked with the `"use client"` directive:

<CodeBlock
  code={`"use client"

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

return (
<div>
<p>Count: {count}</p>
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
Increment
</button>
</div>
)
}`}
language="tsx"
filename="components/Counter.tsx"
/>

## Composing Components

The real power comes from combining server and client components:

```tsx
// app/dashboard/page.tsx
import Counter from '@/components/Counter'
import ServerData from '@/components/ServerData'

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <ServerData />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

React Server Components are transforming the landscape of web development by combining the best aspects of server-rendered and client-side interactivity.
