# Advanced MDX Features

This post demonstrates the enhanced MDX capabilities now available on our blog.

## Custom Components

### Callouts

<Callout>This is a default info callout.</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Success">
  Your changes have been saved successfully!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
  This action cannot be undone. Proceed with caution.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Error">
  Something went wrong. Please try again later.
</Callout>

### Code Blocks

Code blocks now have syntax highlighting and line numbers:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)

  // This is a multi-line code example
  // to demonstrate line numbering
  return {
    message: `Hello, ${name}!`,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  }
}

// Call the function
greet('World')
```

You can also use the CodeBlock component directly:

<CodeBlock
  code={`const heading = "Custom Code Block";
console.log(heading);`}
  language="typescript"
  filename="example.ts"
/>
