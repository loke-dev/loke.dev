Performance is a critical aspect of modern web development. Let's explore some effective techniques to speed up your website.

## Image Optimization

Images often account for the largest portion of page weight:

<Callout type="warning" title="Performance Impact">
  Unoptimized images can significantly slow down your website and hurt user
  experience.
</Callout>

Use Next.js Image component to automatically optimize images:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/profile.jpg"
      alt="Profile picture"
      width={300}
      height={300}
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

## Code Splitting

Break your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks:

<CodeBlock
  code={`// Using dynamic imports
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('@/components/HeavyComponent'), {
loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
})

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Page</h1>
      <HeavyComponent />
    </div>
  )
}`}
  language="tsx"
  filename="app/page.tsx"
/>

## Core Web Vitals

Focus on these key metrics:

| Metric | Description              | Target  |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------- |
| LCP    | Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s  |
| FID    | First Input Delay        | < 100ms |
| CLS    | Cumulative Layout Shift  | < 0.1   |

## Implementing Prefetching

Prefetch critical resources:

```tsx
// In Next.js, links are automatically prefetched
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

By implementing these performance optimizations, you can significantly improve your site's loading speed and overall user experience. Remember that performance is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
