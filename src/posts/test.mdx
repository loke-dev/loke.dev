# Welcome to My Blog!

This is a test post showing how MDX works on this site. MDX allows us to use React components directly within Markdown content.

## Markdown Features

MDX supports all standard Markdown features:

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, world!')
}
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to emphasize important information.

## Conclusion

With MDX, we get the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown for content authoring, and the power of React components for interactivity and complex UI elements.
