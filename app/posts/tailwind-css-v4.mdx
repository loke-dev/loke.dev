# What's New in Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind CSS v4 brings significant improvements and new features to the popular utility-first CSS framework. This release focuses on performance, developer experience, and new styling capabilities.

## JIT-Only Engine

Tailwind CSS v4 has fully embraced Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation, completely removing the old engine. This change brings several benefits:

- Faster build times
- Smaller CSS output
- No more configuration for JIT mode
- Improved developer experience with immediate feedback

## Lightning-Fast Performance

The rewritten engine in v4 delivers impressive performance improvements:

- Up to 10x faster than v3
- Near-instantaneous CSS generation
- Significantly reduced memory usage
- Much faster HMR (Hot Module Replacement) updates

## Experimental Features Now Stable

Many experimental features from v3 are now stable and fully supported:

- Container queries
- Has selector
- Parent selector `&`
- Logical properties
- Color function syntax
- More advanced arbitrary values

## Simplified Configuration

The configuration in v4 has been streamlined:

```js
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

export default {
  content: [
    './app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#3b82f6',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
} satisfies Config
```

## New Styling Capabilities

Tailwind CSS v4 introduces several new styling capabilities:

- Advanced color manipulation
- More granular typography controls
- Improved dark mode support
- Enhanced responsive design utilities
- Better custom property integration

## Migration from v3

Migrating from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4 is relatively straightforward for most projects:

1. Update your dependencies
2. Adjust your configuration file format
3. Check for any deprecated utilities
4. Update any custom plugins

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS v4 represents a significant step forward for the framework, with its focus on performance, developer experience, and new styling capabilities. The JIT-only approach simplifies the architecture while delivering impressive speed improvements that make development even more enjoyable.
